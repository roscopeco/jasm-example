## Example JASM Gradle project

This is an example of using the JASM assembler and gradle plugin. 
There's not much here currently but it will be fleshed out as things develop.

This project uses [The JASM Gradle plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.roscopeco.jasm).

```
./gradlew build
```

Note that JASM requires Java 17 or above - it will not work with lower versions.
